ðŸ§  Pro Tips for Practice:
Start easy and master the fundamentals (sorting, loops, indices).

Then move to Kadane's, prefix sum, sliding window, etc.

Practice in C++, and dry-run your solution manually.

Use platforms like LeetCode, GFG, InterviewBit, or Coding Ninjas Studio for structured practice.
